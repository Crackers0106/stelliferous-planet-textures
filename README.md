## About
The mod currently puts a [lil pinapple](https://github.com/QuiltMC/art/blob/master/emoji/lil-pineapple/rendered/lil-pineapple.png) in the MC skybox since it doesn't have any actual planet textures yet.
The orbit speed is also 100x what it is normally to demo what this mod does for the time being.

This mod got its name from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_of_an_expanding_universe#The_Stelliferous_Era
